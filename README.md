#### *As written above, the project gathered 1 week of power consumption data to identify normal and abnormal power consumption for the lamp. Short duration of data only as a POC for the project.*

### This project modified a USB-powered LED lamp. After gathering enough data, the system could identify normal power consumption and abnormal power consumption. Thus, the system has 2 mode to operate, which managing the power consume by the lamp.

| Normal Mode Operation  | Abnormal Mode Operation |
